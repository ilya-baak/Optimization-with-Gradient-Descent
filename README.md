# Optimization-with-Gradient-Descent
Uses the numpy and matplotlib libraries to implement both Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms for optimizing an objective function. 
In GradientDescent.py, I have implemented both Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Algorithms using numpy. 
This is used to optimize the objective function described in the file. 
In GDPlots.py, both of these algorithms are run with different parameters (learning rate, number of iterations, etc) and plot the number of iterations against the value of the objective function by using matplotlib.
